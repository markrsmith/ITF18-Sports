Comments:
Okay, there's some bugs here. One, I pick a team name, but it never references that name again. Then, on the coin flip, I picked heads
and I got this: "[Pick Heads or Tails]?
Heads
You Chose Heads and it was 7!
You Chose Heads and it was tails!
ah this dont matter"

I'm not sure if you're scoring system works and seems almost impossible to score in a quarter. Also, I had quarter 2 twice. Where'
three and four?
